# RetrOS – Custom Firmware for Clone R36S (rk3326 Variant)

** NOT FOR "REAL" R36S CONSOLES **

** INTERNAL FIRMWARE VARIANTS WITH TF1 HIGHEST SUPPORT **

** BRAND NEW DEVELOPMENT. PATIENCE PLEASE. **

** PROBLEM? FILE AN ISSUE **

Welcome to **RetrOS** – a clean, stable custom firmware for clone Temu R36S handhelds powered by the RK3326 SoC. RetrOS is purpose-built to boot from TF1, restoring and enhancing factory behavior with modern tweaks, deeper hardware support, and full image portability.

Use Balena Etcher and GOOD SD Card - SD Cards with bad MBR can break easily. Black screen NO LED.

## 🚀 What’s Inside RetrOS

RetrOS is based on a hybrid build from factory NAND firmware, fused with stable bootloader components from K36 Clean. It combines:

- ✅ **More Themes** Sourcing themes stinks, more built right in!
- ✅ **MBR** from K36 Clean — ensuring reliable boots on any card size
- ✅ **Custom kernel + DTB** for R36S (rk3536 variant) with correct analog stick mapping
- ✅ **Direct NAND extraction** of factory system partition
- ✅ **Fixed splash screen support** (logo_kernel + system splash)
- ✅ **Support for USB, WiFi (depending on module), and SSH**
- ✅ **Re-enabled EmulationStation features** like *Collections*, *Ports*, and *Netplay*

## 🔧 Technical Overview

- **Boot**: Clean `extlinux.conf`-based U-Boot setup with optional UUID or device path booting (`/dev/mmcblk1pX`)
- **Kernel**: Pulled from NAND image for perfect analog stick support; later builds will include modular kernel support
- **DTB**: Uses `rf3536k3ka.dtb`, which fixes analog direction and input registration
- **System**: Based on clean EmuELEC 4.x series with modified init and terminal utilities
- **Splash**: Boots with `logo_kernel.bmp` and optional `plymouth`-like splash image (neon gamepad design included)

## 🛠 Use Cases

- 🧪 **Reverse engineering**: Full NAND mirror used for analysis
- 💾 **System restoration**: Reflashable image with correct bootloader
- 🎮 **Custom OS base**: Great for modders and retro gaming OS devs
- 💡 **Reference firmware**: Use RetrOS as a clean baseline for custom EmuELEC builds

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- ⏱️ Boot is slightly slower (~30s) using factory kernel; WIP kernel builds may improve this
- 🔌 WiFi support depends on compatible USB dongle or onboard chip (not all are supported)
- 🛠️ Recovery tools are not included by default; mount the STORAGE partition externally to debug

## 🧠 Coming Soon

- Automatic resizer for STORAGE on first boot
- Built-in busybox terminal launcher (for low-level debugging)
- Optional RetroArch core updater integration
- RetrOS OTA build script for kernel patching + image generation
- More Unlock and Utility Apps
- Update and Standalones and Cores for Offline
- Verify all compatible Wifi Dongles
